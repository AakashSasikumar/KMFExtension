# KMF Unlocker

[toefl.kmf.com](https://toefl.kmf.com/mock/) is a website that I used pretty often for my TOEFL preparation. This page is blocked by shield and a blur effect for people accessing it from outside of China. I got tired of opening inspect element, and deleting/modifying the HTML elements to make the page accessible, so I decided to make a chrome extension that automates this process.

## Installation

1. Open `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **developer mode**
3. Click on the **load unpacked** button
4. Select this folder

## Usage

After the installation, just chill. The extension does it's job without any further intervention.
